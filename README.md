# ski_avalanche_app

A Flutter application to connect with a button for avalanche airbag triggering. This was part of a larger design project
for the University of Toronto Engineering Science second semester design course. You can read more about what I did in this project [here](https://www.calummurray.ca/projects/avalanche-airbag-trigger-system).
